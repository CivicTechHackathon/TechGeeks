 ####### Digital Platform for Citizen Services  ########

Problem theme: Citizen Service

Technologies: Blockchain Technology, Hyperledger Fabric, Node JS

Problem Statement: Citizen services is one of the fundamental rights of a citizen. In Pakistan availing citizen services is full of hassles and a hectic process. We are proposing a digital platform to provide basic citizen services to its citizens. The proposed system will be based on blockchain technology which will secure the sensitive data from misuse. Initially for prototype purpose we added a single module i.e. Land records. We will add more modules in later phases.
